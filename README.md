- 👋 Hi, I’m Ethan "Stefani" Day.
- 👀 I’m interested in type theory, computer graphics, and sound synthesis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning real analysis, working from a text with a constructive approach and using a proof assistant to code my work.  I think constructive type-checking proof assistants have a lot of potential as an assistive technology for mathematics learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the design of declarative media-generation interfaces that facilitate aesthetic coherence and graceful quality degradation.
